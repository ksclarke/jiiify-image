This is the first (preliminary) release of the jiiify-image library. It's a Java library for working with the [IIIF Image API](http://iiif.io/api/image). There is no server component to jiiify-image. The library is intended to be used in a server or, alternatively, in a client-side (or command line) application. In addition to providing a Java model for the API, jiiify-image provides some image manipulation capabilities. It does not yet implement the full specification (for instance, there is no JP2 support).  Bug reports, suggestions for improvement, and pull requests are welcome. Work on jiiify-image is ongoing on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify-image).
